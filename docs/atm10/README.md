# All The Mods 10 (Alpha)

???+ Danger "ALPHA DISCLAIMER"
	ATM10 is in public ***alpha***, meaning there will be bugs, missing mods, no traditional ATM endgame, missing quests, etc. It will be getting frequent updates as mod devs update to 1.21, and the ATM dev team continues to work on adding new mods, quests, and scripts. [You can report bugs and make suggestions here.](https://github.com/AllTheMods/ATM-10/issues/)

**All The Mods** started out as a private pack for just a few friends that turned into something others wanted to play! It has all the basics that most other "big name" packs include but with a nice mix of some of newer or lesser-known mods as well. 

The biggest changes this time around are that we are now using **NeoForge** and **EMI** and we are on the version **1.21**. Expect many updates as mods come out!

In **All the Mods 10** we will continue the tradition adding many new mods while going for more stability.

Does "**All the Mods**" really contain **ALL THE MODS**? No, of course not.
